## Feature Requests

Py-Template started as a tool for **my own workflow**, but I want to make it useful for a broader audience.

Ideas that would be especially valuable:

- New project templates
- CI/CD integrations (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
- Developer tools (MyPy, Pre-commit, Black, etc.)

If you’d like to propose one, please open an issue first so we can discuss it.

## Code Style

Use Ruff for linting and formatting:

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
```

Keep code type-annotated where possible.

Follow existing project structure and conventions.
